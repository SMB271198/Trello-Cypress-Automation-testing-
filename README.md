# Trello-Cypress-Automation-testing-
I was trying to Add email and password into fixture folder and add a environment variables but i was unable to add because this site is having so macy cross browsing i.e multi domains 
so it was unable to take elements from cypress.config.js file.
also i am trying to click on log out button but due to same reason i was unable.
so, cypress is not correct tool for the automate this site as cypress does not suporting multi domain change.
